# Data Mining Practice 3

This project integrates all the concepts from previous practices to create an end-to-end data mining pipeline. It covers everything from data preprocessing to model building and optimization.

## Overview
This project implements a complete data mining workflow, including:
- Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
- Building and optimizing machine learning models.
- Preparing the pipeline for deployment-ready insights.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Documentation and insights for deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - jupyter

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-Darvish/DataMining_Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd DM_P3
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Execute the cells in `DM_P3.ipynb` sequentially.
