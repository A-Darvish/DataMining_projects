# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains a collection of data mining projects completed as part of coursework. Each project focuses on a different aspect of data mining, including regression, classification, clustering, and association rule mining.

## Projects

### 1. [P1: Regression and Classification](P1)
- Techniques: Linear and Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.
- Focus: Predicting population levels using various regression and classification algorithms.

### 2. [P2: Model Comparison](P2)
- Techniques: SVM, Bayesian Networks, Random Forest, KNN.
- Focus: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch and comparison of model performance metrics.

### 3. [P3: Clustering and Association Rules](P3)
- Techniques: PCA, K-Means, DBSCAN, Association Rule Mining.
- Focus: Dimensionality reduction, clustering on multi-dimensional datasets, and discovering association rules in transaction data.
